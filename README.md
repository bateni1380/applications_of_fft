# applications_of_fft
This is a notebook that is showing some applications of Fast Fourier transform in music, noise cancellation and image compression!

This is a presentation for Mathematical Analysis course tought by Dr. Kianfar in January 2023 at Amirkabir University of Technology.
You can see the presentation in Persian here:

You can see the notebook and slides in rep files too.

Basicly, what fft does is it gets a plot of a wave that is combination of sine waves with diffrent frequencies and it returns frequencies of the inisial waves so its usefull wherever signals ocure.
